# 📈 Lead Scoring Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Lead Scoring is a crucial technique in marketing and sales that helps businesses prioritize potential customers based on their likelihood to convert. This project analyzes customer data to assign scores to leads, enabling businesses to focus on high-potential prospects and improve conversion rates.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees)

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset includes customer demographic details, behavior data, and engagement metrics.
- Key Features:
  - `Lead Source`: Origin of the lead (e.g., website, referral, social media)
  - `Lead Activity`: Frequency of interaction with the company
  - `Demographics`: Age, location, industry, etc.
  - `Conversion Status`: Whether the lead became a customer (1: Converted, 0: Not Converted)

## 🔍 Key Insights
✅ Identified top-performing lead sources contributing to conversions.  
✅ Derived engagement patterns that impact lead conversion probability.  
✅ Developed a machine learning model to classify high-value leads.  

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, feature encoding, and normalization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Understanding trends, correlations, and visualizing distributions.
3. **Feature Engineering** - Selecting key variables that impact lead conversion.
4. **Model Building** - Implementing classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) and comparing performance.
5. **Model Evaluation** - Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure effectiveness.

## 📌 Results
- Achieved **X% accuracy** using Random Forest (adjust based on actual results).
- Reduced false positives, ensuring high-quality leads are prioritized.
- Generated actionable insights for sales teams to improve customer targeting.
